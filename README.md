# ⭐ Dynamic Visual SLAM

A curated list of **Dynamic Visual SLAM** papers and resources, focusing on SLAM systems that robustly operate in **dynamic environments** with moving objects, non-rigid scenes, and scene changes.

This repository covers topics such as **motion segmentation, dynamic object handling, semantic SLAM, optical flow, scene flow, multi-view geometry, and learning-based approaches** for dynamic scenes.

If you find missing or ignored papers, feel free to **open issues or submit pull requests**.
Contributions of any kind are welcome!

If you find this repository useful, a ⭐ would be greatly appreciated 😊
